<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my portfolio site for my work as a full stack web developer. It serves as an introduction to who I am, my journey from classical music performance to web development, and as a hub to all of my projects so far that I have created through Thinkful's web development course. I hope you enjoy my work, continue to visit for future projects and updates to current ones, and consider hiring me to help you with whatever you need.</p>
